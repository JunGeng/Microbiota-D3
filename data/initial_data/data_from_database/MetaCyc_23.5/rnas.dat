COMMON-NAME - 16S ribosomal RNA (rrsA)
COMMENT - The 16S rRNA is the RNA component of the small subunit (30S subunit) of the <i>E. coli</i> ribosome. 
/
/There are seven ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons, called <i>rrsA</i>, <i>rrsB</i>, <i>rrsC</i>, <i>rrsD</i>, <i>rrsE</i>,
/<i>rrsG</i>, and <i>rrsH</i>.  Each operon contains a 16S rRNA gene, a 23S rRNA gene, and a 5S rRNA gene
/(except the <i>rrsD</i> operon, which contains two 5S rRNA genes) interspersed with various tRNA genes. 
/Regarding nomenclature, "<i>rrs</i>" genes encode 16S rRNAs, "<i>rrl</i>" genes encode 23S rRNAs, and
/"<i>rrf</i>" genes encode 5S rRNAs |CITS: [COLISALII]|.

/ribosome assembly, structure, and function has been characterized, interactions between the 16S rRNA and
/ribosomal proteins have been described, mutants have been analyzed.  16S rRNA is subject to post-transcriptional
/processing, methylation, and pseudouridylation.  Possible roles for the modified nucleotides have been proposed
/|CITS: [17389639]|; their location has been visualized in a cryo-EM structure of the ribosome |CITS: [25707802]|.  
/
/The 16S rRNA is targeted by a number of antibiotic agents.  The functional interactions between antibiotic sensitivity
/and 16S rRNA have been examined in detail.
/
/Reviews describing these results are available.
/
/Regulation has been described in detail; for a review see |CITS: [12732305]|.

COMMON-NAME - tRNA-Trp(CCA)
ANTICODON - CCA
CITATIONS - 7033244:EV-AS-TAS:3370115660:shearer
COMMENT - tRNA(trpT) is the sole tryptophan tRNA.
/
/tRNAs are the adapters that allow synthesis of proteins from mRNAs.
/Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome for protein synthesis.
/There, the tRNA recognizes an RNA codon with its own three-nucleotide
/anticodon, thus allowing synthesis of a specific peptide based on an mRNA
/template.
/
/tRNAs are processed to their active, mature forms by RNA cleavage
/and by modification of their bases. RNA cleavage consists of
/removal of both 5' and 3' extensions in a multistep process involving
/many RNases |CITS: [11252717]|. RNases taking part in tRNA processing include |FRAME: CPLX0-3461|,
/|FRAME: CPLX0-3601|, |FRAME: EG10858-MONOMER|,
/|FRAME: EG11620-MONOMER|, and |FRAME: CPLX0-3602|. tRNAs are also subject to a
/wide variety of base modifications catalyzed by proteins such as
/|FRAME: EG11932-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG10595-MONOMER|, |FRAME: G6364-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG11344-MONOMER|,
/|FRAME: G7199-MONOMER|, |FRAME: CPLX0-1101|, |FRAME: EG11779-MONOMER|, |FRAME: G7422-MONOMER|,
/|FRAME: G7449-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG11177-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG10454-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG10967-MONOMER|,
/and |FRAME: EG11022-MONOMER|.
/
/Mature tRNAs are linked via a 3' CCA sequence to their cognate
/amino acid in an ATP-dependent fashion by the appropriate
/amino-acid-tRNA synthetase, as shown in the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|.
/Subsequently, these charged tRNAs interact with the ribosome
/and template mRNA to generate polypeptides. The discovery of the
/role of tRNA in protein synthesis is reviewed in detail in |CITS: [7033244]|.
/
/Based on mutational analysis, the anticodon and G73 are both important
/determinants in aminoacylation of tRNA(trpT) |CITS: [1721699]|.

UNIQUE-ID - RNPB-RNA
TYPES - Misc-RNAs
COMMON-NAME - RNase P catalytic RNA component
CITATIONS - 6197186:EV-EXP-IDA:3694464675:fulcher
COMMENT - Gene <i>rnpB</i> encodes a catalytic RNA that is capable of cleaving other RNAs. The 1989 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech for the discovery of catalytic RNAs. Altman's work focused on the characterization of <i>E. coli</i> RnpB RNA |CITS: [1701103]|.
/
/RnpB RNA and RnpA protein together comprise the ribonuclease P (RNase P) holoenzyme |CITS: [386349][6164392]|. RNase P acts in processing of tRNA precursor molecules |CITS: [1104100][167017][4560501]| and the stable 4.5 S RNA precursor |CITS: [794064]|. The RnpB RNA subunit alone exhibits catalytic activity toward tRNA precursors <i>in vitro</i> under high ionic strength conditions, but requires the protein subunit under physiological conditions and for efficient activity toward a 4.5 S RNA precursor substrate |CITS: [6197186][6199841][1717693][16163391]|. The protein subunit stabilizes the global structure of the RNA component, allowing it to exhibit the properties of the holoenzyme complex |CITS: [16163391]|. RNase P also exhibits activity toward C4 repressor RNA of bacteriophages P1 and P7, which may indicate a role for RNase P in lysogeny/lysis regulation |CITS: [7597035]|, and toward CI RNA, which is involved in immunity to bacteriophage P4 |CITS: [12051840]|. RNase P, and its RNA subunit alone, can also cleave a tRNA-like structure in turnip yellow mosaic virus |CITS: [3359488]|. RNase P can also initiate precursor tRNA processing at the 3' ends of some long primary transcripts by endonucleolytic cleavage of the Rho-independent transcription terminator |CITS: [25183518][17981836][27288443]|.
/
/Activity of the RNase P holoenzyme and RnpB RNA on precursor tRNA substrates has been extensively characterized |CITS: [1104100][167017][1099089][1099090][1103144][2474662][765341][2199767][1701142][6197186][6199841][3023854][2423112][3359488][2468523][2266141][1718000][3061798][7680114][7535857][7730292][8628683] [7527466][8341661][8799129][9558342][9571638][9790839][11170376][11871663][1371349][10339557][10637323][10653690][10843849][11226427][11926814][12904300][19932118][22315063]|.

Additional substrates studied include a bacteriophage phi80-induced RNA |CITS: [778851]|, the <i>E. coli</i> <i>btuB</i> encoded coenzyme B12 riboswitch |CITS: [16061811]|, turnip yellow mosaic virus RNA |CITS: [3359488]|, and polycistronic tRNA transcripts |CITS: [17981836][18033800][25183518]|. RnpA also participates in substrate binding and recognition |CITS: [19932118][24056935][25273134][27693057]|.
/
/Early studies implicated RNase P in RNA processing and explored the effects of <i>rnpB</i> mutants |CITS: [6154228][6195144][3047674]|.

/
/RnpB RNA is essential for cell viability |CITS: [1699929]|. Mutations in RnpB RNA and in the RnpA protein subunit of RNase P exhibit different effects on tRNA precursor processing |CITS: [2464697]|.

COMMENT - tRNA(sec) is a special tRNA that inserts selenocysteine at certain in-frame
/UGA codons.
/
/tRNAs are the adapters that allow synthesis of proteins from mRNAs.
/Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome for protein synthesis.
/There, the tRNA recognizes an RNA codon with its own three-nucleotide
/anticodon, thus allowing synthesis of a specific peptide based on an mRNA
/template.
/
/tRNA(sec) can insert selenocysteine at certain in-frame
/UGA codons |CITS: [3033637]|. The ability of tRNA(sec)
/to insert selenocysteine appears to depend on the specific
/sequence and folding of a stem-loop 3' to the insertion site |CITS: [1834670][1396569]|.
/tRNA(sec) has
/poor affinity for the normal elongation factor EF-Tu,
/instead binding to the specialized |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| |CITS: [2408012][2531290]|.
/The aminoacyl acceptor helix of tRNA(sec) promotes
/binding to |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| and prevents binding to EF-Tu |CITS: [1939093][2524495]|. 
/
/tRNAs are processed to their active, mature forms by RNA cleavage
/and by modification of their bases. RNA cleavage consists of
/removal of both 5' and 3' extensions in a multistep process involving
/many RNases |CITS: [11252717]|. RNases taking part in tRNA processing include |FRAME: CPLX0-3461|,
/|FRAME: CPLX0-3601|, |FRAME: EG10858-MONOMER|,
/|FRAME: EG11620-MONOMER|, and |FRAME: CPLX0-3602|. tRNAs are also subject to a
/wide variety of base modifications catalyzed by proteins such as
/|FRAME: EG11932-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG10595-MONOMER|, |FRAME: G6364-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG11344-MONOMER|,

/and |FRAME: EG11022-MONOMER|.
/
/Mature tRNAs are linked via a 3' CCA sequence to their cognate
/amino acid in an ATP-dependent fashion by the appropriate
/amino-acid-tRNA synthetase, as shown in the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|.
/tRNA(sec) is charged in a two-step process, being aminoacylated
/with L-serine by |FRAME: SERS-CPLX|, then having that associated amino
/acid converted to selenocysteine by |FRAME: CPLX0-1141|, as shown
/in |FRAME: PWY0-901| |CITS: [2963963][1839607]|. 
/Subsequently, these charged tRNAs interact with the ribosome
/and template mRNA to generate polypeptides. The discovery of the
/role of tRNA in protein synthesis is reviewed in detail in |CITS: [7033244]|.
/
/tRNA(sec) varies in areas that are otherwise invariant across 
/most tRNAs |CITS: [2963963][2529478]|. Many of these differences
/act to prevent incorrect addition of selenocysteine at random
/UGA stop codons |CITS: [1370545]|. tRNA(sec) has an unusual
/acceptor stem consisting of seven, rather than eight base pairs,
/which is required for proper function |CITS: [1702199]|. 
/
/The solution structure of tRNA(sec)
/has been chemically evaluated |CITS: [8510147]|.

COMMENT - tRNA(serT) is one of five serine tRNAs.  Approximately 4.2% of tRNA<sup>Ser1</sup> contains a novel modification, 5-methoxycarbonylmethoxy-2'-<i>O</i>-methyluridine (mcmo<sup>5</sup>Um) at the wobble base U34.  This modified tRNA<sup>Ser1</sup> is predicted to recognize the UCG codon more efficiently than mcmo<sup>5</sup>U |CITS: [26681692]|.

The discovery of the role of tRNA in protein synthesis is reviewed in detail in |CITS: [7033244]|.
/
/Recognition of tRNA(ser) by |FRAME: SERS-CPLX| depends on tertiary rather than primary structure |CITS: [8114091]|. This interaction has been evaluated by a 4 &Aring; resolution structure of tRNA(ser) bound to |FRAME: SERS-CPLX| and by footprinting |CITS: [8508916][2068094]|. In addition, kinetic studies show that the extra stem loop structure of tRNA(ser) makes the biggest contribution to kcat and kM of aminoacylation, and that the anticodon stem loop is not involved |CITS: [8233780]|. 
/
/The identity and relative abundance of serine tRNAs that use various serine codons have both been examined |CITS: [4925825][3911956]|.  
/
/A temperature-sensitive mutation in <i>serT</i> leads to a cell-division defect and reduced synthesis of certain proteins |CITS: [374381][6376117]|. The latter correlates with decreases in mRNA and can be suppressed by mutating the RNA degradation genes <i>rne</i> and <i>pnp</i>, suggesting the effects of the <i>serT</i> mutant do not occur solely at the translational level |CITS: [9515904]|.

/GC in the anticodon stem that allows ribosomal P-site binding |CITS: [8460138][8331078][8557626]|. 
/The tRNA(met) acceptor arm is important
/in allowing formylation |CITS: [1917939][1373194]|. The specific role
/of initiator tRNAs is reviewed in |CITS: [7507918]|. 
/
/The role of formylated tRNA(met) as an initiator rather than an elongation tRNA is 
/controlled by the relative
/abundance of |FRAME: EG11036-MONOMER| and |FRAME: EG10505-MONOMER| |CITS: [8798391]|.
/
/Formylated tRNA(met) has been shown to bind RNA polymerase and 23S rRNA, as well
/as modulating transcription from some promoters |CITS: [787983][349554][6987670][3532031]|.
